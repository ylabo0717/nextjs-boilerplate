# Coding Guidelines

This document provides an overview of coding standards and best practices for Next.js 15.x (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript projects.

> **üìã Important:** These guidelines have been split into multiple files. Please refer to each specialized guideline for detailed information.

## üìö Guidelines Structure

These guidelines are divided into the following files:

- **[Overview](./coding-guidelines-overview.en.md)** - Basic policies, SSOT principles, prohibited practices
- **[TypeScript](./typescript-guidelines.en.md)** - Type definitions, naming conventions, type guards
- **[Next.js Patterns](./nextjs-patterns.en.md)** - Server/Client Components, routing, React design
- **[Architecture Guidelines](./architecture-guidelines.en.md)** - Function-first approach, design patterns
- **[Security](../security/security-guidelines.en.md)** - Secure implementation patterns, vulnerability countermeasures
- **[Performance](../quality/performance-guidelines.en.md)** - Optimization, accessibility
- **[Development & Maintenance](../development/development-guidelines.en.md)** - State management, error handling, styling
- **[Testing](../quality/testing-guidelines.en.md)** - Test strategy, test pyramid
- **[Review Checklist](../quality/review-checklist.en.md)** - Cross-cutting concerns for PR reviews

## Key Principles (Excerpts)

The following are the most important principles common to all guidelines. Please refer to each specialized guideline for details.

### 1. Security First

Always handle sensitive information and final authentication/authorization on the server side. On the client side, limit to auxiliary guards such as "early redirect/conditional display for UX improvement" and do not make decisions that cross trust boundaries (permission determination/sensitive data retrieval).

> üìñ Details: [Security Guidelines](../security/security-guidelines.en.md)

### 2. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

Manage all constants and configuration values in one place, avoiding duplication.

> üìñ Details: [Overview Guidelines](./coding-guidelines-overview.en.md#single-source-of-truth-ssot-principle)

### 3. Pure Functions First Approach

Use pure functions in 99% of cases, consider classes only in extremely exceptional cases (complex internal state / performance optimization that is significantly difficult with pure function composition).

> üìñ Details: [Architecture Guidelines](./architecture-guidelines.en.md)

### 4. Thorough Type Safety

Make maximum use of TypeScript features and avoid using the any type.
