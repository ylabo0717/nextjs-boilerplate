# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Note on Configuration

The `repo` field in `config.json` is set to `"WILL_BE_AUTO_REPLACED"` as a placeholder.
This value is automatically replaced with the actual repository name (from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable)
during the GitHub Actions workflow execution. You don't need to manually update this value.
