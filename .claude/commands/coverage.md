# Request to Improve Test Coverage

## Request Details

/serena Please add tests to improve test coverage.
Some files currently have less than 80% coverage, which does not meet our project quality standards.
First, please add tests so that coverage exceeds 80%.
However, simply increasing coverage is not meaningful, so please add tests from the perspective of quality assurance and bug detection.
When adding tests, please check the existing test code in advance to avoid duplicating content.
There are always potential bugs, so it would be better if these additional tests help detect latent issues.

80%を達成したら次にそれを100%にするためのテストを追加してください。

## Notes

- Naturally, make sure that the added tests pass.
- Skipping tests is strictly prohibited.
- If you notice any strange behavior, always analyze whether the issue lies in the implementation or the test itself.Be sure to identify the root cause and make appropriate corrections.
