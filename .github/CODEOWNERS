# CODEOWNERS file for automatic review assignment
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/about-code-owners

# Order matters: the last matching pattern takes precedence
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners

# Default owners for everything in the repo
# These owners will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# Replace with your GitHub username, team name, or organization
# Format: @username, @org/team-name, or user@example.com
